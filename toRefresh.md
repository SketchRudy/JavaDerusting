# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

Things I was stuck on:

ArrayPractice.java
    - Create an array of Strings of size 4 (forgot syntax)
ListPractice.java
    - Create an empty ArrayList of Strings and assign it to a variable of type List (forgot syntax)
ListPractice.java
    - Collections (I've only heard about it, going to need to crash course it later)
StringPractice.java
    -  Join all of the strings in the list together into a single string separated by commas
       Use a built-in method to achieve this instead of using a loop
MapPractice.java
    - How to "put"(lol) things into a map
    - Find size of a map
    - Iterate over the entries in the map, printing each key and value
